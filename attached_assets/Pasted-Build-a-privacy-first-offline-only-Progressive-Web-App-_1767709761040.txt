Build a privacy-first, offline-only Progressive Web App (PWA)  called ** EgoOs** designed for deep personal reflection and self-exploration.

The app functions as a private mental archive where a user can safely record and revisit their dreams, goals, attractions, crushes, preferences, values, and personal reflections. The application must feel mature, calm, minimal, and intentional, not playful or social-media-like.

CORE PRINCIPLES

Absolute privacy: No user accounts, no cloud sync, no analytics, no tracking, no external APIs.

Offline-first: All functionality must work without internet access.

Local-only storage: Use IndexedDB (preferred) or localStorage, with optional client-side encryption before persistence.

Personal use only: No sharing, comments, likes, or public features.

MAIN SECTIONS / MODULES

Implement structured sections with customizable labels:

Dreams & Goals: Long-term visions, ambitions, future plans

Crush Log: Names or nicknames, admiration reasons, emotional notes

Attractions & Preferences: Text-only reflections on personal attractions, patterns, and preferences (no explicit media support)

Things I Love: Music, aesthetics, ideas, places, activities, moments

Free Thoughts: Unstructured journaling space

Mood & Reflection: Daily emotional check-ins with optional emoji indicators

Each entry should support:

Title (optional)

Rich text body

Tags / labels

Timestamp

Edit and soft-delete capability

NAVIGATION & UX

Sidebar or bottom-tab navigation (minimal, distraction-free)

Timeline view to browse entries chronologically

Global search across all entries

Tag-based filtering

Keyboard-friendly and mobile-optimized

SECURITY & PRIVACY FEATURES

App-level PIN lock required on launch

Auto-lock after inactivity

Optional biometric unlock (if platform supports it)

Optional encrypted export of data as a local .json file

No screenshots or share buttons

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Dark-mode default (soft blacks, muted neutrals)

Calm typography (modern sans-serif, high readability)

Minimal animations (subtle fades only)

No bright colors, no gamification

Emotionally safe, introspective aesthetic

PWA REQUIREMENTS

Installable on desktop and mobile

Service worker for offline caching

TECH CONSTRAINTS

Frontend-only implementation

No backend, no databases outside the browser

Modular, maintainable code structure

Easily extendable with future features (AI prompts, analytics, cloud sync — disabled by default)

OVERALL GOAL

Create an app that feels like a locked journal meets a personal operating system for the mind — private, calm, honest, and deeply personal.

The experience should encourage self-awareness and reflection without judgment, social pressure, or external validation.
